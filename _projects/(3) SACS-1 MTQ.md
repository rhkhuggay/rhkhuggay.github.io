# SACS-1 Magnetorquer
###### **Collaborator:** Liliana Figueroa
###### November 2022 - June 2023
showcases my process of building an actuator (i.e. magnetorquer) used in a 1U CubeSat for our club, Sacramento Area Community Satellite-1 (SACS-1) from design to manufacture. SACS-1 is a club in Sacramento City College that aims to be the first community college to successfully build a CubeSat.

**Magnetorquers** are electromagnetic magnets that utilize the magnetic field of the earth to perform 3-axis rotation in space. Its low cost and simple structure make it a perfect actuator for a 1U CubeSat. Its an important component because it plays a key role in the detumbling system of the nanosatellite once it is launched to space. It makes it so the CubeSat is stable where it has low vibration and doesn’t stray away from its orbit. It is also responsible for rotating the nanosatellite on its desired orientation in space.

In manufacturing the components, a coil winder is designed inorder to expedite the process. A **coil winder** is a machine that create windings around the metal core as well as for the air core magnetorquer. For the initial schematic, a stepper motor is used to rotate the support/metal core in place and pulls the wire from the spool that is held by a frame to provide translational constraint. This is a necessary tool because it significantly speeds up the process in creating windings as magnetorquers typically need about 200-400 windings. It also keeps consistent tightness around the material being wounded.
