**Abstract:** This investigation aims to characterize the material properties of various
common household duct tape brands. Tape samples from each of the four brands (Duck,
3M, Scotch, and Gorilla) were tested to failure using an Instron following the specifications
of ASTM D882. The results were used to calculate/measure the Young’s modulus, yield
strength, and ultimate strength of each material. Testing revealed significant variation
between brands, with Duck brand tape exhibiting the highest Young’s modulus at 452
MPa, while Scotch brand tape had the lowest at 196 MPa. For yield strength, Scotch tape
had the highest at 12.4 MPa while 3M tape had the lowest at 2.7 MPa. Finally, for ultimate
strength, Duck tape had the highest at 18.9 MPa while Gorilla tape had the lowest at 12.4
MPa. Based on a cost analysis of the data, Duck brand tape provides the best overall value
for money.

**Conclusion:** This research provides a comprehensive mechanical characterization of four household duct tape brands. The goal of the research was to characterize the material properties of the tapes, specifically Young’s modulus, yield strength, and ultimate strength. For Young’s modulus data, we found that the Duck brand tape to be the highest at 452 MPa, while the lowest was Scotch at 196 MPa. The relatively large range of values does not say anything about the strengths of the tapes, but does showcase the range of stiffness values among different tapes. In situations where users are putting their tapes in tension and do not want large deformation, the high stiffness of Duck tape would be an important consideration. For yield strength data, we found Scotch brand tape to have the highest yield strength at 12.4 MPa, while 3M had the lowest at 2.7 MPa. However, the value for 3M tape appears to be much lower than the rest as the Duck brand tape has a yield strength of 10.5 MPa and Gorilla tape has one at 5.1 MPa. Finally, for ultimate tensile strength we found Duck brand tape to be higher than the rest at 19.0 MPa, while the lowest was Gorilla brand tape at 12.4 MPa. The ultimate strength metric is one of the most important in evaluating tapes as this would be the stress above which the tape no longer holds any tension. Overall the Duck tape excelled in stiffness and ultimate tensile strength while Scotch tape excelled in yield strength. The results underscore the importance of matching tape selection to specific application needs. Broader implications of these results suggest that understanding mechanical properties can optimize tape selection in household and engineering applications. Future research could expand the scope of testing by evaluating adhesive properties, fatigue resistance, and environmental durability under various conditions. Hence, further studies could expand the sample size and include dynamic testing for adhesive performance.
