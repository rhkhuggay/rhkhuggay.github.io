# Obstacle Detection Car
###### **Collaborator/s:** Jacob Feingold, Panithan Lertsuntivit
###### November 2022 - June 2023

The goal of this project is to build a Remote Controlled (RC) car that detects and alerts the user of surrounding obstacles. It showcases a concept for blindspot monitoring system in cars to increase driver awareness through the use of an ultrasonic sensor or Lidar. This is useful especially in non-ideal condition (e.g. fog, rain, night) that reduces visibility when driving.
