# SACS-1 Magnetorquer
###### **Collaborator:** Liliana Figueroa
###### November 2022 - June 2032
This project showcases my process of building an actuator (i.e. magnetorquer) used in a 1U CubeSat for our club, Sacramento Area Community Satellite-1 (SACS-1) from design to manufacture. SACS-1 is a club in Sacramento City College that aims to be the first community college to successfully build a CubeSat.

**Magnetorquers** are electromagnetic magnets that utilize the magnetic field of the earth to perform 3-axis rotation in space. Its low cost and simple structure make it a perfect actuator for a 1U CubeSat. Its an important component because it plays a key role in the detumbling system of the nanosatellite once it is launched to space. It makes it so the CubeSat is stable where it has low vibration and doesnâ€™t stray away from its orbit. It is also responsible for rotating the nanosatellite on its desired orientation in space.

In manufacturing the components, a coil winder is designed inorder to expedite the process. A **coil winder** is a machine that create windings around the metal core as well as for the air core magnetorquer. For the initial schematic, a stepper motor is used to rotate the support/metal core in place and pulls the wire from the spool that is held by a frame to provide translational constraint. This is a necessary tool because it significantly speeds up the process in creating windings as magnetorquers typically need about 200-400 windings. It also keeps consistent tightness around the material being wounded.
