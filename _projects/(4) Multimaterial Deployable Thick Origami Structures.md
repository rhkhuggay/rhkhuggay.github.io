<!-- What is the hardest problem you have had to solve?
S - Multimaterial samples can be folded numerous times. To test fatigue, we had to fold hte sample at least 200 times to show reliable result. Can’t be done manually as each cycle need to be folded at the same rate and this has to be done for 9 different samples with different parameters.
T- Coming up with a testing apparatus for fatigue of multimaterial samples
A - brainstormed for a while. Came up with configuring a Ender V2 3D printer at the Gu Lab. 3D printed necessary to attached to the extruder. Learned and generated G-code to automatically apply continuous load on sample. 
R- Invented a reliable fatigue testing machine for folding.  -->
